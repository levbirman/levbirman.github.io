  <h1>Learning Order Parameters From Data</h1>

  <p>Upon first venturing back into my studies of the statistical mechanics of self-assembling systems after some brutality
    only a PhD program could provide, I got to thinking about order parameters, which are usually studied in the context of equilibrium phase transitions.
    They are of course used in other contexts as well, and indeed we'll be interested in those contexts at a later time, but for now we'll discuss
    the typical case, as this paper talks about exactly that.
